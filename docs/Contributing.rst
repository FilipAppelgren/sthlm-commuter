Here's some information regarding on how you can contribute to different aspects
of the project. Such as,

* The Documentation


Adding To The Wiki
------------------

The documentation is hosted and can be viewed here on ReadTheDocs,
while the source files are located on the `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/Team-Eight/sthlm-commuter/tree/gh-pages/docs/>`_.

* Editing

  To edit the current page, simply click the "Edit on GitHub" - found at the top of the page,
  or head over to the `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/Team-Eight/sthlm-commuter/tree/gh-pages/docs/>`_ to see all files.


* Adding a new page

  In order to add a new page you need to do three things,

  1. Decide whether you would like to use the **reStrucutredText** or the **Markdown** syntax.

    - `reStrucutredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_ has some more functionality but might be more complex.
    - `Markdown <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>`_ is easier and the same syntax as GitHub uses for it's '.md' - files.

  2. Create a file on GitHub

    - `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/Team-Eight/sthlm-commuter/tree/gh-pages/docs/>`_ with either the '.md' - for Markdown or '.rst' for reStrucutredText.

  3. Add the name of the file to the index

    - Add the name of the file to the `Index-File <https://github.com/Team-Eight/sthlm-commuter/blob/gh-pages/docs/index.rst>`_ , without the filetype-extension, so that the compiler becomes aware of it. After each saved edit, a push will be sent and the documentation will be recompiled.
