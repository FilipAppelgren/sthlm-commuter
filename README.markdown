Setting up the project
----------------------

Once forked and imported to eclipse you need to run "Fix Project Properties".
This is found under Android Tools. 

You then need to add the following class that holds the api endpoint and point 
out where the api is located.

    public class ApiSettings {
        public static String STHLM_TRAVELING_API_ENDPOINT = "";
    }
