STHLM Traveling
===============

Travel in Stockholm with your Android phone.

STHLM Traveling helps you plan your journeys using data from Stockholm Public 
Transport (SL, Stockholms Lokaltrafik). 

More about this project at <http://markupartist.com/sthlmtraveling> or follow 
me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/johanni) where I announce new versions.

The app is powered by two backend services. The journey planner in the app is
written in php and screen scrapes sl.se. The other one is written is Java and
hosted on Googles AppEnginge and is used for deviations and real time data.

Setting up the project
----------------------

Once forked and imported to eclipse you need to run "Fix Project Properties".
This is found under Android Tools. 

You then need to add the following class that holds the api endpoint and point 
out where the api is located.

    public class ApiSettings {
        public static String STHLM_TRAVELING_API_ENDPOINT = "";
    }

---------

To be able to run the tests from Eclipse follow these instructions. These 
instructions assume that you alrady have STHLM Traveling setup as a project and
deployed.
